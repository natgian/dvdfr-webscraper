# dvdfr-webscraper

A web-scraper to get data from the weekly dvd/blu-ray news on the dvdfr.com website.

## Features

Scrapes the title, label, EAN code, release date and link to detail page from the dvdfr.com weekly news listing page. It then creates headers and rows and puts it together in CSV format so it can easily be imported into an excel file.

## Technologies Used

- Javascript
- Node.js

## Installation

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. clone the repository
2. install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. run `node scrape`

I used "pkg" to create a standalone executable.
